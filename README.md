# Rusteomics - mzio

![](placeholder_for_badges_TODO)

In this crate we try to provide efficient readers (and some writers) of the most common file-formats in proteomics. You can find readers and writers for FASTA-, MGF-, MSP- and other plain-text-formats as well as XML (e.g.: mzML, mzID) and some binary formats.  

The core project is written in rust which can be found in `mzio-rs`. FFI-implementations can be found in `mzio-XX`, like `mzio-py` for python.



Documentation can be found here! (Link to github pages)
